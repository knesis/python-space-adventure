Notes:
1. Install pygame and PIL. Pygame will be necessary for the Asteroid dodging game and the Simon memory game. PIL is needed for the Space Quiz.
2. The main file is python_final_menu.py. Use it to create/load profiles, start the game, etc.
3. Some features (such as fonts) may not work depending on operating system. 
   In that case, replace all references to 'ar destine' and 'ocr a std' with 'arial'. Note, this may affect word sizing issues.
4. Developed in Python 2.7, executed using PyCharm.
5. This is an old project (2016), unsure about nature of copyright for images.
